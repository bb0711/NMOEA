## NMOEA: Node Embedding and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for Co-authorship Prediction

### Final Project for KAIST-AI506: Data Mining and Search (finished on 30 July, 2020)
- I and my teammate implemented this code for our final team project and I copied the code (just for my job interview).


-  As far as we known at that time, we first applied node embedding and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Co-authorship prediction.
- This repo also contains final report for our project, so if you want to see it you can check it easily :)
